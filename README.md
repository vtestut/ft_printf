# ft_printf

Welcome to my `ft_printf` project! 
This project was pretty fun, it challenges us to implement a custom version of the `printf` function from the C standard library.

## Project Overview

The `ft_printf` project is designed to deepen your understanding of variadic functions, string formatting, and the inner workings of the `printf` function. Key features include:

- **Conversion Specifiers:**
  - Implement support for various conversion specifiers (`%s`, `%d`, `%x`, etc.).
  
- **Flags and Modifiers:**
  - Handle flags and modifiers for precise formatting (`-`, `0`, `*`, `.`).

- **Width and Precision:**
  - Support minimum field width and precision options.

- **Variadic Arguments:**
  - Master the use of variadic arguments to handle a variable number of input parameters.

## Contents

- **`/srcs/`:** Contains the source files, including the main `ft_printf` function.
- **`/include/`:** Header files, including `ft_printf.h`.
- **`/tests/`:** A directory for test cases to validate the functionality of your `ft_printf`.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `/srcs/` directory and review the source files.
3. Compile the project using the provided Makefile (`make`).
4. Create a test program or use the provided test cases to ensure your `ft_printf` functions correctly.

Special thanks to Ecole 42 for the inspiration and learning opportunity.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
